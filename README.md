# S&P500 Stock Price Prediction Pipeline

This is a backup of the final assignment for the ELEC0136 Data Acquisiton and Processing Systems (DAPS) module I took in my final year at UCL.

This project predicts the S&P 500 closing price using historical stock data, including features from AAPL and MSFT. It demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline from data acquisition and storage to model training and evaluation with the use of Python and scikit-learn.

At the end, an 8-page report was written in LATEX to summarise the methods and results of the project. The report has been given a provisional score of 73/100.
