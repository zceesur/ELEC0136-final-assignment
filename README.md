# ELEC0136-final-assignment

This is a backup of the final assignment for the ELEC0136 Data Acquisiton and Processing Systems module I took in my final year at UCL.

This project predicts the S&P 500 closing price using historical stock data, including features from AAPL and MSFT. It demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline—from data acquisition to model training and evaluation—using Python and scikit-learn.
